/**
 * Resolves Web Awesome design tokens to concrete sRGB hex.
 *
 * Monaco's theme API takes hex and nothing else: `Color.fromHex` returns *red* for
 * any string it cannot parse. Web Awesome tokens are not hex — they are `var()`
 * chains that bottom out in `color-mix(in oklab, …)` or relative colour syntax, and
 * reading a custom property back with `getPropertyValue()` yields that expression
 * unevaluated. So the token is resolved in two hops:
 *
 *   1. A hidden probe element gets `color: var(<token>)`. Reading the computed
 *      `color` longhand makes the engine evaluate the chain down to a real colour.
 *   2. That colour string — serialised as `rgb()`, `oklab()` or `color(srgb …)`
 *      depending on the engine — is painted into a 1×1 canvas and read back as
 *      sRGB bytes, alpha included. The browser does every colour-space conversion.
 *
 * A fully opaque pixel (alpha byte 255) resolves to `#rrggbb`; anything less opaque
 * resolves to `#rrggbbaa`, so a token that carries its own transparency is not
 * silently flattened to solid — Monaco's `Color.fromHex` accepts both forms.
 */

/**
 * Two sentinels, because a canvas silently *ignores* a `fillStyle` assignment it cannot
 * parse, leaving the previous value in place. Assigning the candidate over each sentinel
 * in turn tells the two cases apart: a parseable colour normalises to the same string
 * both times, while an unparseable one leaves each sentinel untouched, so they differ.
 *
 * A single sentinel cannot distinguish "unparseable" from "genuinely `#000000`", and
 * would drop a legitimately black token.
